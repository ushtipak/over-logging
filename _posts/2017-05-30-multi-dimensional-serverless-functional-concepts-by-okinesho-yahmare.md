Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...

Recently I attended a conference that featured 90% of headlines with words alike

Ironically, after listening a bunch, reality hit me with the fact that most of
these were "mnyeeh" (aka: nothing special), and the talks that I liked best
were some hacky ones, that didn't promise much from the start, but also didn't
promote themselves with buzzwords

Won't be naming the conference, though, it was good-ish, aside from all the buzz...
There were more than a few talk tracks in parallel, spread in a day or two
(not covering numbers, since, bundled with the fact that I mentioned it was recent
from $(date +%F), one could easily figure out which IT convention it was).
But fear not, sadly, buzz word problem was not unique in this convention,
most of them are now running in the similar fashion

On the account of slightly disappointing facts – recently I heard that one of
the largest hacking confs in the world (let's face it – most "well known")
takes in thousands of people, while there is enough place for a half of that at
best, heaving most of attendees marching from one room to another, in search of an
empty seat

So... what about the post title?
Two of my friends and I came up with it, alongside the idea of hosting a meetup
with the very (made up) theme and see how many people would show up

We haven't done that (...yet), but for the confs and meetups in general –
do try to gather as much info before hitting it, but still do visit as many as
possible – you'll certainly learn something new and enjoy it, I'm sure – buzz aside
