    with marvelous representation of digits

    `python3 /opt/alphonses-hat/alphonses-hat.py &`)

🕢 Try with 3 ninja and 2 frosted diffusers

🕗 Go to sleep and enjoy the darkness, but fail to see if the clock is
    actually turned on at all

> from left to right: bedroom door, night cabinet, bed, shelf with the clock


🕡 Disassemble everything and try with only 3 ninja diffusers

🕘 Tell everyone on Facebook you're a miracle worker that can sleep at night
    _and_ see the clock

🕓 Connect everything with plastic twisties

🕚 Take everything apart and wait for 2-3 months because you have 0 ideas how
    to advance with design

🕛 Have an epiphany and settle with the final shape of Raspi clock
